        Food mess subscriptions have become increasingly popular in recent years
        as more people seek convenient and healthy meal options. However,
        traditional monthly subscriptions can be limiting for those who only
        want to subscribe for a short period of time or who have a changing
        schedule. To address this need, Messing is a platform that allows users
        to choose food mess subscriptions from food messes around them for a
        time period of their own choice, with a minimum of one day.

        The platform provides users with a wide range of options for food mess
        subscriptions, allowing them to choose from a variety of cuisines. Users
        would be able to select the duration of their subscription, starting
        from a minimum of one day, allowing them to have more flexibility in
        their meal planning.
